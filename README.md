# Python Learning Journey (Python-100-Days) 🐍

Hi, I'm **Ryan Lyu**, a **Physics student at the University of Groningen (RUG)**.  
📅 Started: **2026-01-24**

This repository records my Python learning journey, mainly based on:

- **jackfrued / Python-100-Days**
  - https://github.com/jackfrued/Python-100-Days

I will use this repo to track progress, organize notes, and store practice code.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a solid Python foundation
- Improve coding fluency through consistent daily practice
- Learn by writing real, runnable code (not only reading)
- Prepare skills useful for physics/data-related tasks in the future

## 📌 Learning Plan
This repo follows the structure of **Python-100-Days**, including (but not limited to):
- Python fundamentals
- Data structures
- Functions & modules
- File I/O
